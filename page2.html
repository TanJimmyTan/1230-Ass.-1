<h1>Sydney - Barangaroo Reimagination</h1>

<p>Barangaroo is an urban tramsformation that attempts to create space from old docking wharves to accomodate the rapid expansion
 and growth of Sydney. Barangaroo attempts to provide commercial, retail, and living spaces while also creating an icon to
 attract tourists and further the tourism industry in Australia.

 <br>
 There are 4 main parts to this project. The International Towers, which provides more commercial space than the Sydney CBD, Barangaroo
 Wharf, which creates more points of entry and commute options into the city, the Crown Casino, a new 6 star hotel casino,
 and Barangaroo Reserve, an artificial open headlands area.

 <br>
 International Towers
 <br><br>
The international Towers represent the commercial aspect of the Barangaroo transformation. The international Towers provide a huge
 amount commercial space that aimed at being used as a global business site, rather than a local commercial space likee the Sydney CBD.
 Not only is it a business space, these towers act as an icon of Barangaroo, 3 imposing towers set as the backdrop of Sydney.

 <br>
 Barangaroo Wharf
 <br><br>
 Barangaroo Wharf is a new wharf that aims to keep the sleek aesthetic of the towers, and provide a secondary commute option for people
 traveling around the city. Not only does it increase the flow of people into Barangaroo, it also means that the spread of people within
 the city is decreased, reducing traffic within Sydney.

 <br>

 <br><br>
 The Crown Casino is the 2nd legal gambling institution wihtin Sydney, the first being the Star Hotel. The Crown Casino however, is
 intended to be the first 6 star hotel in Sydney, and aims to become an icon to attract interest in travelling to Australia.

 <br>
 Project Evaluation
 <br><br>
 The project itself can be evaluated based on whether or not each aspect was successful in its endeavor. To begin, the aim of the 
 International Towers was to accomodate for the growing commercial state within Sydney, and reduce traffic flow within the city. By moving
 a large amount of comemrcial traffic into Barangaroo, traffic congestion within Sydney has decreased, and with a commercial space larger
 than the Sydney CBD, the International Towers have achieved their goal of accomodating for the growwing commerce within Sydney. Barangaroo
 Wharf provides new entry points into the city, and also reduces traffic flow around the city, adding to the goal of reducing traffic
 in Sydney.
