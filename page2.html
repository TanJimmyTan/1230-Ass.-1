<h1>Sydney - Barangaroo Reimagination</h1>

<p>Barangaroo is an urban tramsformation that attempts to create space from old docking wharves to accomodate the rapid expansion
 and growth of Sydney. Barangaroo attempts to provide commercial, retail, and living spaces while also creating an icon to
 attract tourists and further the tourism industry in Australia.
 <br><br> 
 There are 5 main parts to this project. The International Towers, which provides more commercial space than the Sydney CBD, Barangaroo
 Wharf, which creates more points of entry and commute options into the city, the Crown Casino, a new 6 star hotel casino, 2 CLT
 buildings, advocating greener solutions to construction and Barangaroo Reserve, an artificial open headlands area.
 <br><br>
The international Towers represent the commercial aspect of the Barangaroo transformation. The international Towers provide a huge
 amount commercial space that aimed at being used as a global business site, rather than a local commercial space likee the Sydney CBD.
 Not only is it a business space, these towers act as an icon of Barangaroo, 3 imposing towers set as the backdrop of Sydney.
 <br><br>
 Barangaroo Wharf is a new wharf that aims to keep the sleek aesthetic of the towers, and provide a secondary commute option for people
 traveling around the city. Not only does it increase the flow of people into Barangaroo, it also means that the spread of people within
 the city is decreased, reducing traffic within Sydney.
 <br><br>
 The CLT houses advocate greener construction solutions, using Cross Laminated Timber rather than regular steel and concrete, reducing
 greehouse pollution during construction. These houses are called the International House and Daramu House.
