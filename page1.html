<h1>New York - East Side Coastal Resiliency</h1>

<p>Dry line – New York – Bjarke Ingels
East Side Coastal Resiliency<br><br>



The Transformation
 <br><br>
This transformation involves the NYC lower manhattan waterfront to implement a 12km long infrastructure barrier. 
 This barrier protects the city against flood water as well as improve eco-friendly ideas with green areas built on top. 
 Another aspect that is improved is the general space and access people have to the waterfront by raising roadways near the waterfront. The space underneath is able to be made into new community spaces such as seating, shops, parks and gardens.

 <br>
Intent
 <br><br>
Green areas allow for a larger variety of eco-friendly spaces that New York can possess, allowing a larger ‘Green’ presence overall.
The flood barriers are to be implemented for the purpose of blocking flood water and restricting its access into the city.
Improved waterfront spaces and access with the raised roadways and new parks allow for a more enjoyable waterfront.

<br><br>
What data would be needed to test for success?
 <br><br>
The City and its people would be untouched by flood water during a coastal flooding
 <br>
East Side shore air quality would be improved by the green areas by filtering dust and pollutants from the air
 <br>
 The general numbers of people visiting the water front would be raised
